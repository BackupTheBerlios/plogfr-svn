This is my first pLog template so please excuse any 
errors :)

I include several plugins in this template.
The plugins installed are as follows..

  Gravatar
  Karma

  Auth Image

  Custom Field code for Current Mood 

This template is made of 5 seperate sections with a possible of 6.
Each section is self contained within the style.css so it should be
easy to seperatly customize and control.

I attempted to make the css as descriptive as possible.
And along those lines, each div was attempted to be created 
seperatly for each section.

I included an image hover highlight code which was grabbed from
CSS Drive. This creates a nice effect for images.
I also changed the css within the Flickr template to use this.
The original code can be found at
http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/examples/exampleitem/highlight_image_opacity/


The 5 sections are

1. The Header.
The header also contains a menu bar which can be customized 
throught css file. The code for the meny bar was borrowed from
CSS Drive which you can find the code by going to
http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/examples/exampleitem/jk_cool_css_menu/

2. Left Menu

3. Right Menu
This section has the 'About Me' installed
and a section for your blog links.

4. Background
In this template set I have included an image
for the background, to help show how it works.
Is sets behind all other sections.

5. Main Section
This section is where all your main blog 
information shows. Such as posts, photos, archives, links..
anything that you show on your blog will be in this section.
It floats above the background section, but behind the 
Left and Right menu.

The possible 6th section is a subheader.
I have included the css for it and the template file for it.
It would sit below the header, behind the Left and Right Boxes and above the 
Main Section.

I hope you enjoy :)
