1. Introduction
===========================
Now, almost every template used in pLog is based on <Div> tag to design the 
layout, but sometimes, it will not work fine on every Web Browser. The main 
problem is the location of each <Div> tag.

So I want to create one Template based on <Table> tag to design the layout, so
that's what you reading now:). I have tried this template on my Blog: 
http://www.totodotnet.net, and I will keep on progressing this template. At the 
mean time, I will release some different color skin based on different CSS
file, so at that time, you can change the different color as you like.

2. Install Note
===========================
To install my template is simple. There are 2 ways to add this tempate to your
pLog system, just simple do as following steps.

A. Solution 1: Add my template by menaul:

	a. Upload all the template file to a new directory under the Template/
	   directory like Template/toto
	b. Enter your pLog administration interface, choose Site Admin -> Add 
	   Template -> Manually Add Template
	c. Just input the directory name of your new template directory like
	   toto
	d. Click Add Template, that's all!

B. Solution 2: Add my template by upload one compressed file

	a. Enter your pLog administration interface, choose Site Admin -> Add 
	   Template -> Add Template
	b. Click Browse... and choose your local compressed template file.
	c. Click Add Template, isn't it easy?:)


3. Howtos
===========================
There are something you might want to chang as you like, such as add some logo 
picture to your header or footer, or use some plugins.

a. There is a fine plugin made by markwu called Recently Comments, just like MT,
I have used this plugin in my blog, so just place the panel.template file with 
panel_with_comments.template file and rename this file to panel.template, it's
a great plugin

b. Some Chinese user might want to show there chinese characters, so just 
replace the styles.css with styles_zh_cn.css and rename this file to styles.css,
that's will be fine, like my blog.

c. I have deleted some "|escape" switch in template files, that's for double-byte
user.


One more thing, if you want to show some code in your blog, you can switch the
edit component in Administration Interface, and surround such a tag with your 
code:
	<pre class="code">some dummy codes....</pre>
It works fine in my blog:).
